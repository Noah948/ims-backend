# To add new modal
```
I am adding a new [ModelName] to my SaaS inventory system.

Architecture rules:
- Multi-tenant (user_id required)
- Soft delete where appropriate
- PostgreSQL
- SQLAlchemy ORM with back_populates
- lazy="selectin"
- Production ready

Existing relations:
[short summary only]

Design:
1. The new model
2. Relationships needed
3. If any existing model needs minor addition, show only that part
4. Keep scalable and clean
5. Update the Summary i gave to include this new model without spoiling the exixting structure.
```

# To update service and route file

```
I have updated this model and schema:

MODEL:



SCHEMA:



Here is my existing service and route file:

SERVICE:



ROUTE:



Review everything and:
1. Identify what must change
2. Show only necessary modifications
3. Ensure nothing else breaks
4. Keep it production-ready
5. Do not rewrite unrelated code
6. Give me updated routes and service file to paste and use
```
